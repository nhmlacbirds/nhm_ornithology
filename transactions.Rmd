```{r}
transac <- read.csv("transactions.csv")

# change date format
transac$dated <- as.Date(transac$date, format = c("%m/%d/%Y"))
transac$year <- as.numeric(format(transac$dated,"%Y"))
```

Might not be useful since a lot of transactions are missing dates... 

```{r}
ggplot(transac, aes(x=year)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Number of specimens moved", x = "Year", y = "Count") +
  mytheme
```
